# blueberry-core v1 

## Protocol Summary

Blueberry Core v1 a leveraged yield-farming product. 
Additional documentation can be found [here](https://docs.blueberry.garden/).
Here are some key features:

The protocol is integrated with existing lending protocol (Blueberry Money Market). Whenever a user wants to borrow funds (on leverage) to yield farm additionally, Blueberry Bank will borrow from the lending protocol (Blueberry Money Market).

- A wide varitey of assets are borrow-able, including stables like USDC, USDT, DAI.
- Each "spell" defines how the protocol interacts with the end deployment. Such as concentrated liquidity vaults, e.g. Ichi vault.
  - Spell functions include e.g. `_deposit`, `_withdraw`.
- Adjustable positions - users can adjust their existing positions by supply more assets (Isolated collateral), borrow more assets, or repay some debts.
  - As long as the collateral credit (Deployment + Isolated Collateral value) >= borrow credit. Otherwise, the position is at liquidiation risk.
  
## Protocol Components

- BlueberryBank
  - Store each position's collateral tokens (in the form of wrapped NFT tokens)
  - Users can execute "spells", e.g. opening a new position, closing/adjusting existing position.
- Spells (e.g. Ichi,Uniswap/Aura/Convex/...)
  - Define how to interact with each external protocol
  - Execute `borrow`/`repay` assets by intereacting with the bank, which will then interact with the lending protocol (Blueberry Money Market).
  
### Component Interaction Flow

1. User -> BlueberryBank.
   User calls `execute` to BlueberryBank, specifying which spell and function to use, e.g. `_deposit using IchiSpell.
2. BlueberryBank -> Spell
3. Spell may call BlueberryBank to e.g. `_doBorrow` funds and `_doRepay` debt. Funders are then sent to Spell. to execute pool interaction.   
4. Spells -> Pools   
   Spells interact with Pools (e.g. optimally swap before supplying to Uniswap, or removing liquidity from the pool and pay back some debts).
5. (Optional) Stake LP tokens in wrapper contracts (e.g. WStakingRewards for Uniswap + Balancer).
6. Spell may put collateral back to BlueberryBank.
   If the spell function called is e.g. to open a new position, then the LP tokens will be stored in BlueberryBank.
   
## Example Execution

### putCollateral

1. User calls `execute(0, USDT, WETH, data)` on BlueberryBank contract. `data` encodes IchiSpell function call with arguments (including how much of each asset to supply, to borrow, and slippage control settings).
2. BlueberryBank uses data call to encoded `putCollateral` function call with arguments to IchiSpell.
3. IchiSpell executes `putCollateralWERC20`
  - `_doBorrow` from the lending protocol
  - Deposit Single asset into ICHI vault and recieve LP Token
  - Wrap LP tokens to wrapper WERC20 (toget ERC 1155)
  - `_doPutCollateral` wrapped tokens back to BlueberryBank
  - Refund leftover assets to the user.
  
<!---  >For **Uniswap** pools with staking rewards, use `putCollateralWStakingRewards` function.
>For **Sushiswap** pools with staking in masterchef, use `putCollateralWMasterChef` function.
>For **Balancer** pools with staking rewards, use `putCollateralWStakingRewards` function.
>For all **Curve** pools, use `putCollateral[N]` (where `N` is the number of underlying tokens). The spell will auto put in Curve's liquidity guage. --->

## Oracle 

Prices are determined in USD.

- For regular assets, asset prices can be derived from Chainlink, Band, or Uniswap feeds.
- For LP tokens, asset prices will determine the optimal reserve proportion of the underlying assets, which are then used to compoute the value of LP tokens. See `Uniswapv3AdpaterOracle.sol` for example implementation.
