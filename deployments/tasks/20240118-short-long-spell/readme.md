# 2024-01-18 ShortLongSpell

The ShortLongSpell contract is a factory contract that defines how Blueberry Protocol interacts for leveraging an asset either long or short. It extends the BasicSpell contract and is responsible for depositing and withdrawing assets, as well as opening and closing positions. The contract utilizes OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20Upgradeable and SafeCast libraries, as well as interfaces from other contracts like ISoftVault, IWERC20, and libraries from Paraswap.
